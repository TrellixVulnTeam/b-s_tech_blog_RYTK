### Installation  üíæ
Your application‚Äôs folder structure must follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. You‚Äôll need to use the [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) package to implement Handlebars.js for your Views, use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

You‚Äôll also need the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables, the [bcrypt package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash passwords, and the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) and [connect-session-sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize) packages to add authentication.


```bash
  npm install

Finally you will enter the last command to connect to the server: 
```bash
  npm start
```


### Usage ‚ö°
This application does not have front-end built, but it allows you to test routes and their functionality using Insomina.
